## Summary

Dashboard improvements and bug fixes day. Added login button for 2FA restart, implemented persistent connection manager to eliminate status flickering, fixed SPY price display (BATS exchange), and fixed P&L calculation to show per-position values.

---

## Completed

### 1. Login Button for 2FA Restart
Added a login button that appears when the gateway is not logged in, triggering a container restart to prompt 2FA.

**Files modified:**
- `api.py` - Added `/api/gateway/restart` endpoint using Docker socket API
- `dashboard.html` - Added login button with spinner animation
- `docker-compose.yml` - Mounted Docker socket into trading-bot container

**How it works:**
1. Login button appears when `logged_in=false`
2. Clicking triggers POST to `/api/gateway/restart`
3. Dashboard polls every 3 seconds for 2FA completion
4. User authenticates via IBKR mobile app

### 2. Persistent Connection Manager
Created background thread that maintains a single persistent connection to IB Gateway, eliminating dashboard status flickering.

**New file:** `connection_manager.py`
- Background thread with own event loop
- Updates cache every 5 seconds (status, orders, positions, SPY price)
- Dashboard endpoints read from cache instantly (no IBKR latency)
- Uses `clientId=50` (read-only, separate from trading `clientId=0`)

**Files modified:**
- `api.py` - Updated endpoints to use connection manager
  - Startup/shutdown events for manager lifecycle
  - Status, orders, positions read from cache

### 3. Fixed SPY Price Display
SPY price was showing "No subscription" (error 10089) because live data requires paid market data subscriptions.

**Root cause:** Using `reqMarketDataType(1)` (live) triggers error 10089 "Requested market data requires additional subscription for API... SPY ARCA/TOP/ALL"

**Fix:** Use delayed data type (3) which doesn't require subscription:

```python
# connection_manager.py
self.ib.reqMarketDataType(3)  # Delayed - no subscription required
self._spy_contract = Stock("SPY", "SMART", "USD")
self._spy_ticker = self.ib.reqMktData(self._spy_contract, "", False, False)
```

**Also fixed in api.py subprocess:**
Changed tick type from "106" to "" (empty string) to match working standalone test.

**Verification:** Created standalone test script `test_spy_quote.py` to confirm delayed data works:
```
SPY last: 689.15, bid: 689.15, ask: 689.16, close: 688.98
```

### 4. Fixed P&L Calculation Bug
Multiple positions of the same contract were showing identical P&L because IBKR reports aggregate P&L per contract type.

**Root cause:** `unrealized_pnl` from IBKR is per-contract, not per-position
**Fix:** Calculate P&L using entry price and current price per position

**Formula (short puts):**
```
P&L = (entry_price - current_price) * 100 * quantity
P&L % = P&L / (entry_price * 100 * quantity) * 100
```

**Example (verified):**
| Position | Strike | Entry | Current | P&L | P&L % |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|-----|-------|
| 9 | 625 | $5.48 | $5.07 | $41.00 | 7.48% |
| 8 | 625 | $5.69 | $5.07 | $62.00 | 10.90% |

## Verification Status

### Live Trading (EC2)
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Connection | Connected (U2619432 - Live) |
| Login | Logged in |
| Ready to Trade | Yes |
| Positions | 9 (with correct individual P&L) |
| SPY Price | $689.51 via delayed data (type 3) |
| URL | http://98.88.118.228:8000 |

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `api.py` | Gateway restart endpoint, P&L calculation fix |
| `connection_manager.py` | New persistent connection manager |
| `dashboard.html` | Login button, status sync |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Docker socket mount |

## Commits

1. `Calculate P&L per position using entry price and current price` - 86ec8c7
2. `Fix SPY price: use delayed data type (3) instead of live (1)` - 2ed4291
3. `Fix SPY in positions endpoint: use empty tick type like working test` - ff90f9f

## Next Steps (for future sessions)

1. Monitor trading execution during market hours
2. Consider adding position age and total P&L to dashboard
3. Add alert for gateway disconnection
4. Consider adding historical P&L tracking
