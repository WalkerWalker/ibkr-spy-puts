## Summary

Discovered and fixed critical connection manager bug. Trade executed successfully after gateway restart. Verified execution callback works on paper trading.

---

## Trade Executed

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Contract | SPY 624P 2026-04-30 |
| Action | SELL 1 |
| Fill Price | $6.16 |
| Position ID | 18 |
| Fill Time | 09:42:00 ET |

Note: Scheduled 09:35 trade missed because gateway was disconnected. Executed manually after reconnection.

## Bug Found: Connection Manager Status Not Updating

### Symptoms

Dashboard showed `connected=true` but cache timestamp was frozen for 35+ minutes. Gateway was actually disconnected (user logged into TWS on laptop).

### Root Cause

In `connection_manager.py`, the `else` branch when `ib.isConnected()` returns `False` did not update the status:

```python
# BEFORE (buggy)
else:
    self._cache.ibkr_positions = []
    self._stop_event.wait(5)
    # Missing: _update_status(connected=False) !
```

### Fix Applied

```python
# AFTER (fixed)
else:
    self._update_status(connected=False, error="Connection lost")
    self._cache.ibkr_positions = []
    self._cache.orders = []
    self._stop_event.wait(5)
```

## Discovery: IB Gateway Socat Proxy

### Problem

Local Docker couldn't connect to IB Gateway. TCP connection succeeded but gateway returned 0 bytes.

### Root Cause

IB Gateway only accepts connections from `localhost` (127.0.0.1) due to `TrustedIPs` setting. The gnzsnz/ib-gateway image uses **socat** as proxy:

| Mode | Direct Port | Socat Proxy Port | Use This |
|------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Live | 4001 | 4003 | 4003 |
| Paper | 4002 | 4004 | 4004 |

### Solution

1. Set `TWS_DOCKER_PORT=4004` in `.env` for paper (4003 for live)
2. Use `docker-compose.override.yml` (gitignored) for local port exposures

See `learning.md` for full documentation.

## Execution Callback Verified

Tested on paper trading:

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Placed BUY MKT order for 630P 2026-03-20 | Order filled at market open |
| Execution callback triggered | Position closed automatically |
| Trade recorded | BUY logged in trade history |

The `ib.execDetailsEvent` callback correctly detects TP/SL fills and closes positions.

---

## Missing Orders Fixed

3 positions were missing TP/SL exit orders:

| Position | Contract | TP | SL |
|----------|----------|----|----|
| 10 | 625P 2026-04-30 | 2.43 | 18.24 |
| 11 | 629P 2026-04-30 | 2.46 | 18.45 |
| 16 | 632P 2026-04-30 | 2.38 | 17.82 |

Used `create_test_position.py` script to add missing orders.

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `connection_manager.py` | Fixed: update status when disconnected |
| `strategy.py` | Fixed: atomic trade attempts with order restore |
| `ibkr_client.py` | Fixed: include cancelled_orders in all failure paths |
| `learning.md` | Created: socat proxy documentation |
| `docker-compose.override.yml` | Created: local dev port exposures (gitignored) |

---

## Bug Found: Missing Orders Root Cause

### The Bug

When a new trade succeeded on first attempt, cancelled orders from conflicting positions were never restored.

### Fix 1: Atomic Trade Attempts (strategy.py)

Each attempt now restores cancelled orders immediately on failure:

```python
if result.success:
    if result.cancelled_orders:
        self.client.restore_cancelled_orders(result.cancelled_orders)
    return order, result

# Failed - immediately restore cancelled orders
if result.cancelled_orders:
    self.client.restore_cancelled_orders(result.cancelled_orders)
```

### Fix 2: Include cancelled_orders in All Failures (ibkr_client.py)

All TradeResult returns now include cancelled_orders:
- Cancel conflict failure
- Sell order not filled
- TP/SL placement failure
- Exception handler

## Deployment Status

All fixes deployed to EC2:
- Connection manager status fix
- Cancelled orders restore fix
- Execution callback verified working
