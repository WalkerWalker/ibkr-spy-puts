### 2. Fixed SFTP Connection

Initial connection failed because wrong username was used.

**Correct SFTP credentials:**
- Host: `ftp2.interactivebrokers.com`
- Username: **`jiaminzhu`** (not `ibkrmarginreport`)
- Auth: RSA key at `~/.ssh/ibkr_sftp_rsa`
- Directory: `outgoing`

```bash
sftp -i ~/.ssh/ibkr_sftp_rsa jiaminzhu@ftp2.interactivebrokers.com
```

### 3. Downloaded New Test File

```
-rw-r--r-- 359 Jan 26 22:53 IBKRtest.txt.pgp
```

### 4. PGP Decryption - Still Failing

```
gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 143E5B91E3F18BA4
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
```

**Key mismatch:**
| Key | ID |
|-----|-----|
| Our key | `CB8958A6EC3AF1C3` |
| IBKR used | `143E5B91E3F18BA4` |

IBKR is still encrypting with the wrong PGP key.

## Action Required

Contact IBKR to re-import the correct PGP public key:
- File: `/Users/jiamin/ibkr-spy-puts/pgp_public_key.txt`
- Our key ID: `CB8958A6EC3AF1C3`

---

## Pending

1. **IBKR PGP key issue** - waiting for them to re-import correct key
2. Store `conId` in database for weekend position verification
